          The Manurawa Law Journal
        </h2>

        <p>
          The Manurawa Law Journal, which is a symbol of rich legal literature available
          not only to the legal fraternity but also to the lay person alike, is a hallmark event
          of the Law Students' Human Rights Movement. This highly acclaimed journal is
          considered as the best publication by any society of Law College and a staple
          of legal literature. Sitting and retired judges, Officers of The Attorney General’s
          Department, Leading Lawyers of the unofficial bar, Legal Academics and Law
          Students annually contribute articles, research papers, case notes and reviews of

             <h4>MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT BAR ASSOCIATION OF SRI LANKA</h4>
               
               <p>" I am extremely pleased to pen this message to
                'Manurawa 2020' journal published by the Law
                Student’s Human Rights Movement of the Sri Lanka
                Law College.
                At a time, when the entire world is compelled to
                deviate from our ordinary life style due to Covid19,
                it is commendable that the Human Rights Movement
                has decided to publish this magazine/journal.
                In the past, the Journal has published many high quality articles. I am
                personally aware that even the legal practitioners make reference to some of
                those articles for furtherance of academic learning.
                Legal literature forms an integral part in every legal system. I hope that this year
                Journal, would keep upto the high standards in the past.
                I wish the Law Student’s Human Rights Movement every success in their future
                programmes. "</p>

            <h2>THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF BILATERAL AND REGIONAL INVESTMENT TREATIES ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
            <p>

              Investment treaties on intellectual property
              are agreements between countries to attract
              foreign direct investment by exploitation
              of intellectual property while providing
              benefits which are subject to the agreed
              terms and conditions. These treaties
              encourage investments between states and
              non-governmental organisations.There
              are different types of investment treaties
              like bilateral, multilateral and regional.
              This study analyses the positive and
              negative effects of bilateral and regional
              investment treaties on intellectual property,
              and provides recommendations to minimise
              the issues therewith.

              It was Nelson Mandela who said:
“There can be no keener revelation of a
society’s soul than the way in which it treats
its children.”
On 12th July 1991 Sri Lanka ratified the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Sri
Lanka had already recognized the
inextricable link between needs and rights,
the indivisibility of rights and the
importance of responding need of children
within a right based contextual framework.
A short time later the Children’s Charter
was promulgated incorporating the
accepted commitments under the
Convention.

            <p>
              The whole notion of “protection” in 19th century international law has been an
              interesting topic for the scholars those who
              want to explore the historiography of modern
              international law from an apologetic point of
              view as 19th century was known as an epoch
              for imperialists for legitimizing the colonial
              expansion. The universality of international
              law was eclipsed by positivism that pervaded
              in the whole domain of 19th-century
              international law. (Anghie, 2005) The idea of
              universality in international law propounded
              by the pioneers of Salamanca School in the
              16th century by reformulating the importance
              of natural law doctrine was scorned and
              reversed by the 19th-century positivists

            <h2>SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PARTITION ACT: AMENDMENT OF THE PLAINT AFTER RETURNING THE PRELIMINARY SURVEY IN A PARTITION ACTION</h2>
            <p>
              Co-ownership of the undivided land is a
              major land dispute in the scenario of Sri
              Lankan land Law. A Partition action is the
              mostly recommended mechanism to terminate
              the co-ownership among all the co-owners by
              the intervention of judiciary. The partition law
              had been introduced through British legal
              system by way of a Partition ordinance No 10
              of 1863 which is an instrument to end-up the
              co- ownership. In additionally drafting a
              Partition deed among all the co-owners is
              another mechanism of terminating the coownership, but if there is a lack of intention of
              following the agreement to divide the land, the
              partition action is the only solution to
              terminate the Co-ownership. According to the
              No 16 of 1951 Partition Act, a separate
              procedure had been introduced to conduct a
              partition action.

            <h2>UNIVERSAL FRANCHISE AND THE CIVIL SOCIETY’S ROLE IN PROTECTING DEMOCRACY (A STUDY OF SRI LANKAN POLITICAL CONTEXT)</h2>
            <p>
              Democracy literally means ‘rule by
              people’, though, in fact, only the elite class
              had the right to rule and participate. Up to
              now there is still no consensus exists on
              how to define democracy. There is merely
              the identification of the core elements
              which are legal equality, political freedom
              and rule of law. Hence, the lack of a
              unanimous definition of “democracy” leads
              to the diversified interpretation,
              implementation and gaps. In many
              countries, the definition of democracy has
              been contested and interpreted differently.
              Some believe that having merely an
              election is enough to be democratic while
              some believe that there are many more
              democratic values such as respect the
              minority, rule of law, political freedom and
              so forth in order to be considered as
              democratic.

              show one exact idea for its concepts. One
              single legal concept may have number of
              interpretations which are delivered by
              variety of jurists. Gradually, deferent
              philosophical ideas with regard to legal
              matters were presented and they developed
              as school of thoughts, Because of that
              nature, the area called jurisprudence has
              been developed over ages.

the inception of Declarations to

            <p>
              Arbitration is perhaps the oldest form of
dispute resolution, and it probably pre-dated
litigation.
It has been used by ancient
civilizations from time immemorial to
resolve disputes and to preserve the peace.
Evidence of its use as an institutionalized
form of social control and dispute resolution
can be found as early as about 3,000 B.C. in
Egypt, Babel and Assyria.

              is interdependence between the rights. The
              paper emphasizes the importance of

            <p>
              As Karl Marx noted, Capitalism teaches a
man to fish, but the fish he catches aren’t
his they belong to the person paying him to
fish, and if he is lucky, he might get paid
enough to buy a few fish for himself.
Accordingly, Marx suggested, “Let the
ruling classes tremble at a communist
revolution. The proletarians have nothing to
lose but their chains. They have a world to
win…workingmen of all countries
unite”
.This article would cause a
jurisprudential insight towards the
renaissance in the influence of the Marxist
theory in the 21st century despite it being
welcomed as far as back in the 19th century.

            <p>
              Born as a human being well equipped with
human rights, it could be heinous to distort the
rights of another by committing a socially
unacceptable act against humanity. Yet, the
sanctum of justice reserves a place for this being,
a glass box in which he stands, exposed to the
world, offered with an opportunity to unveil his
unsworn tale of woe, whose authenticity is only
known to the conscience of this very being. The
under lying notion of this is that how distasteful
the individual is, the justice system will never
denigrate the rights he has as an accused.

            <p>
              Human life is heavily depended on the
sustainability of the environment.
Therefore, the right to clean environment
has been recognized as one of the main
aspects in the human rights context. Some
countries have provided an explicit
reference to the right to clean
environment in their constitutions while
other countries have recognized this right
through the judicial interpretation of the
existing constitutional provisions like
equality before law and right to life.

            <h2> AN ANALYSIS OF THE ADEQUACY OF LAW RELATING TO HIRE PURCHASE IN SRI LANKA; WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE CONSUMER PROTECTION </h2>
            <p>
              With an increasing demand for a better life,
the consumption of goods and services has
been gradually raised. However, the
increasing demand has not been backed up by
adequate purchasing power, which
transforms it into an effectual demand
(Mukharjee and Hanif 1998). As a result of
that, a market has been created for hire
purchase (hereafter referred to as HP) system.
HP is one of the most commonly used
methods to purchase goods on credit. The
foundation of HP agrees to purchase goods in
instalments over some time.

sovereignty is in the people and is

powers of government, fundamental rights
and the franchise.” (Constitution of the

of the People’, which is considered as the
foundation of our second republican
Constitution of 1978, ensures that all the
governmental powers are derived from the
people, and thus all the governmental
agencies, legislative, executive and
judiciary, are answerable to the people.

Lord Lindley has affirmed, "a trust as
equitable obligation to deal with the property
in a particular way". This concept of law

            <p>
              ‘Autochthony’
can be identified as an
exception to the generally unpredictable
experiment of constitution making which
came up with the desire of the dominions
following Ireland or newly independent
countries to be completely free from the
political and legal clutches of the British
Empire and create their own constitutions
(Delan 1957). Political leaders of these
countries with the influence of lawyers who
perceived true independence to be the
Constitution having homegrown roots
promulgated autochthonous constitution
making procedures in their countries.

            <p>
              As
the novel coronavirus has reached
nearly every country on earth, there has also
been mass circulation of falsehoods that
have spread as fast as the virus itself. These
lies have helped pave the path for the
infection, and they have sewn mayhem in
how societies are responding to the
pandemic. Recognizing the danger, United
Nations Secretary-General António
Guterres has warned that “our enemy is also
the growing surge of misinformation”
(Journalism, press freedom and COVID-19,
2020).

            <p>
              Sri Lanka is a beautiful island in the Indian
Ocean. Though it is true, there are some
deleterious factors which caused to destroy
that beauty. Among them disposal of solid
waste is a major environmental issue. At
present in Sri Lanka, it has become a national
concern. Therefore management of solid
waste is essential to overcome the problems

            <h2>ONE IS NOT BORN, BUT RATHER BECOMES A WOMAN </h2>
            <p>
              According
to Simone de Beauvoir, on her
book the “Second sex”, “woman” is a
concept created rather than biologically,
psychologically determined. It is a
construct depending on existing cultural
viewpoints, stereo types, social stigma of
communities which will limit and bound
the female to a certain scope expecting
herself to block her freedom, ironically
freedom for her is a locked cage.

            <h2>HUMANS VS RIGHTS AND ARE HUMANS RIGHT? </h2>
            <p>
              As history with scientific evidence says we
humans are six million years old and the
modern form of humans only evolved about
200,000 years ago. If you as a one human
being on this planet earth, took a long deep
dive into the history of millions and
millions of years of earth there’s no way of
denying we humans are not that old. As we
know civilization is only about 6,000 years
old, and industrialization started in the
earnest only in the 1800’s. Days after days
mankind walked into many eras of
development.

            <p>
              Most people concur with the abortion or
disagree, and few people are dubious. One
side those who call themselves ‘pro-life’.
They say that intentionally causes abortion
is always wrong, although it may on very
rare occasion. on the other side those who
call themselves ‘pro-choice’ or ‘supporters
of abortion rights’, and who regard
intentional abortion as acceptable in some
circumstances.
